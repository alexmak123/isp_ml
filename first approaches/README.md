### all these notebooks were first approaches, until developing the final solution

first_nn_application.ipynb - notebook, that was made during first nn CenterNet application for stroma and epithelium detection on our histological slides

apply_one_class_model_for_a_tile.ipynb - notebook, that was made during changing CenterNet for one class detection (this approach was wrong)

definition_of_brown_color.ipynb - notebook, that was made during first count of hsv color that plasmatic cells have (this approach was wrong)

plasma_cells_counter.ipynb - notebook, that was made for counting total amount of plasma cells on histological images in the specified directory

search_for_plasmatic_cells.ipynb - notebook, that was made during counting results of the first approach when plasma cell was counted as stomal and hsv cut-off was applied
