### These notebooks were made to develop the result solution 

comparing_different_filters.ipynb - notebook, that was made to compare different filters and develop a hsv color cut-off that plasma cells have, using computer vision and image processing methods

result_algo_plasmatic_search_v1.ipynb - notebook, that was made to modify and train 2class CenterNet to 1class CenterNet for only plasma cells detection with the help of changing last layers of segmentation_head (Note: In this notebook metrics were counted with the use of already modified and trained on plasma cells detection CenterNet)

result_algo_plasmatic_search_v2.ipynb - notebook, that was made to add to 1class CenterNet for only plasma cells detection hsv color cut-off that plasma cells have (plus result metrics were counted on test)
